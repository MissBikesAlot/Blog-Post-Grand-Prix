####RULES
* Meet the Team,  and Engineering Lunches count as blog posts. Vimeo views ALSO count   
* If you write one blog post and Marketing separates it into a series, that counts as the series, not the single blog post  
* If number of blog posts is tied for the month, then the tie is broken by what was the most popular  
* If you blog post is written/completed but not published just yet, your blog post will still count towards the month that it was originally written for contributions BUT will count towards the following month for Most Popular Competition  

####BLOG SPECIFIC EVENTS
* __Tweets and Eats__ - Once a month marketing will host a catered lunch blog post session for those that will come and write blog posts for the hour. Food only for those that RSVP. Portland and San Francisco, if you’d like to participate expense your lunch on marketing (_$11/person_) and email receipt to marketing@ and accounting@   
* IF we get a press mention or link from a blog post, marketing will buy a PLC cake for the team. (_Portland and San Francisco, we’ll order in a cake for you, too!_)  
* IF we get a client from a blog post, marketing will buy the first round of a team happy hour at a bar of choice for all offices.   

####REMINDERS ABOUT PUBLISHING AND SUBMITTING BLOG POSTS
* Once a post is written, keep it as a draft and Slack or email marketing@quickleft.com to let us know
